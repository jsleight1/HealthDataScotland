# HealthDataScotland 1.0.0

* First release of HealthDataScotland. This package generates a shiny application for the processing and presentation of GP and Hospital data across Scotland. Data is currently processed locally and saved to an RDS file. The R package and RDS
file are then hosted on [shinyio](https://jack-sleight.shinyapps.io/healthdatascotland/) using rsconnect.
