## Introduction

[HealthDataScotland](https://www.healthdatascotland.co.uk){target="_blank"} is an R shiny application
that presents GP practice demographic and hospital bed capacity data across
Scotland. This vignette will outline the workflow used to download, process and
store the data used by the application, and describe the development process
used to maintain and host the application.

## Data workflow and storage

This application contains public sector information licensed under the Open
Government Licence v3.0. The data used in HealthDataScotland is derived from a
variety of sources on the NHS open data API, which is maintained by Public
Health Scotland. For more information regarding the data workflow, please refer
to `vignette("data_workflow")`.

## Deployment

HealthDataScotland is deployed using the Azure container app platform, which uses
a docker container that is published on
[docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jsleight1/healthdatascotland).

## Reproducibility

The decision to use containerisation for this shiny application was to ensure
reproducibility across the entire workflow of the application from the data
processing to app deployment. The docker image is updated every time a pull
request is merged into the main branch. The latest docker image is then pulled
into production by the Azure container app service.
