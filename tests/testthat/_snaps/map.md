    Output
      [1] "This interactive map displays the locations of all available GP practices\n        (blue pins) and hospitals (red pins) in Scotland. Pins can be selected to\n        visualise individual GP practice or hospital data sets. Please note that\n        some of the spatial data is several years old. Therefore this map\n        may contain missing health centres."
